# advent-of-code-2021

My re-doing of the 2021 advent of code (in rust). Note that I'm not going to be doing the puzzles in order, but rather in the order that I feel like doing them. Also, some days may be skipped if I don't feel like doing them, or if I've done them before (in a different language).
